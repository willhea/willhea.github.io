My parents are avid golfers. Eight years ago, I saw how much fun they were having and how beautiful the courses were. I resolved to learn how to play so I could play with them.

Back at home, I searched for "golf courses near me" and, after the sticker shock of Arlington's private courses, searched for "public affordable golf courses near me." That returned a much more reasonable set of options. The closest course with golf lessons was [East Potomac](https://www.playdcgolf.com/east-potomac-golf-links/). I signed up for the [Get Golf Ready 101 Class](https://www.playdcgolf.com/group-lessons/) and never looked back.

I'm still not a good golfer, but I'm much better and more consistent striking the ball. I can now reasonably play and keep pace with a group, including my parents, which was my goal. I also learned that golf, when you reach a minimum threshold of skill and can maintain the right attitude, is fun! It's been a great way to get out of the house, get fresh air, have fun, and make and maintain friendships. As I'm getting further into middle age, I greatly appreciate a consistent and affordable way to be with friends that isn't going to a bar.

Now, I golf or practice at East Potomac about once every two weeks, even in winter. During the spring and summer, my friends and I will play there up to three times per week. I've gotten many individual lessons with the East Potomac instructors. My wife picked up the game too and we golf together! I've spent more time and money at East Potomac over the years than I care to count, but I consider money well spent at exceptional value.

I've been saddened to see that the [National Links Trust's (NLT) lease with the National Park Service has been canceled](https://golfweek.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2026/01/01/national-links-trust-fundamentally-in-disagreement-trump-leases/87987007007/). As a regular of East Potomac, I cannot speak for the Langston or Rock Creek courses, the difference in quality of management and facilities before and after the National Links course has been night and day. I feel the NLT cares a lot about a high value, affordable, and accessible municipal golf experience for the DC area and they have delivered. [Since taking over](https://www.nationallinkstrust.org/support-washington-dc-facilities):

- NLT added Toptracer shot tracking and heating to the lower covered range bays, allowing comfortable practice in winter. At $20 for 132 balls, East Potomac is the most affordable place to practice by far.
- NLT substantially improved the Red Course, especially the water hazard on holes 6 and 7. Before it was fixed, it had become a shallow mud pit.
- NLT renovated the East Potomac miniature golf course. I don't play mini golf there, but I see families playing there whenever I go to golf. Prior to the renovation, it was empty.
- General greenskeeping improvements. All courses at East Potomac have been better conditions than under prior management. This was the most noticeable and immediate change when NLT took over as stewards of the courses.

Now, this isn't to say that the facilities and courses are on par with the other courses in the area. The Fairfax, VA courses have nicer greenskeeping, but they don't have comparable range facilities near DC. The private courses are far and away nicer in every way, but they are also expensive and exclusive. The DC municipal courses are the only game in town for budget golfers living in or around DC. I especially enjoy East Potomac's three practice holes, rare for the area.

Right now, the worst part about East Potomac is the dumping of material from the White House's East Wing renovation on the White Course, which is not really NLT's fault.

East Potomac is my home course. I started going there because it's close and cheap. I continue to go there because I love the instructors, and the Toptracer range and practice holes are the best practice tools for the money in the DC area. I worry that whoever takes over from NLT won't maintain the same commitment to affordable, accessible golf. If East Potomac weren't available to me, I would definitely golf less.
