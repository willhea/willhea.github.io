Selected projects demonstrating my approach: embed with the team, build visibility, and leave behind systems that last.

## Operation Warp Speed - COVID-19 Vaccine Monitoring

**Role:** Primary U.S. Point of Contact / Product Owner
**Client:** U.S. Government (HHS/DoD) via Controlant
**Duration:** 2020-2023
**Contract Value:** $20M+ annually

### Problem

The U.S. Government needed real-time monitoring of every Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine box in the country. Controlant had the technology but no U.S. presence or government contracting experience.

### What I Did

- Primary liaison between Controlant (Iceland) and U.S. Government stakeholders
- Product owner translating USG requirements to development team
- Built and led the U.S. operations team from scratch
- Managed contract administration: CPARS, DoD payment collection, HHS COR relationship
- Operated weekly scrum cadence for requirements, testing, and change control

### Results

- Successful monitoring of every Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine box in the United States
- Contract value increased 37.5% in one year
- Scaled to national operations with a 4-person team through templating and automation
- Letter of Commendation from General Gustave Perna
- Recognition from President Biden

## Phin Security - Financial Systems Rebuild

**Role:** Director of Operations
**Company:** Phin Security, Inc (Seed-stage cybersecurity startup)
**Duration:** 2024-2025

### Problem

Seed-stage company with four financial systems (Quickbooks, Chargebee, Hubspot, internal database) that had never been integrated. No consolidated view of revenue, churn, or growth.

### What I Did

- Mapped data flows across all systems, identified discrepancies
- Built standardized reconciliation process
- Created Python automation scripts for data extraction
- Built Looker Studio dashboards for real-time financial reporting

### Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Book close time | 2+ months | 3 business days |
| Delinquent invoices | 30% | 0% |
| Bad debt recovered | - | $80,000+ |
| Revenue visibility | None | Real-time dashboards |

Data revealed broken pricing structure and first-90-day churn as primary growth obstacles, enabling strategic decisions.

## WAPA - FTE Reallocation Decision Process

**Role:** Contract Lead / Project Manager
**Client:** Western Area Power Administration (Department of Energy)
**Duration:** 2020

### Problem

Congress sets a fixed FTE cap. Every new hire requires losing an existing position. No transparent way to make these decisions, creating conflict for every vacancy.

### What I Did

- Interviewed leadership across divisions to understand pain points
- Designed multi-stage decision process: standardized intake, manager endorsement, group review with ranked-choice voting, final approval with cost estimates
- Ran simulations with historical data to validate the process
- Trained managers and facilitated initial rounds

### Results

- Framework adopted organization-wide for all FTE hiring decisions
- Still in use today
- Reduced conflict through transparent, consistent criteria

## TPN - Congressional Ethics Automation

**Role:** U.S. Director
**Organization:** Transatlantic Policy Network (NGO)
**Duration:** 2025-Present

### Problem

Congressional ethics package submissions took 30+ days with outside support. Each event involving Members of Congress required detailed itineraries, cost breakdowns, and multiple approvals.

### What I Did

- Mapped the complete ethics submission workflow
- Created reusable templates for common submission types
- Built AI workflows (Claude Code) to draft initial submissions
- Integrated with Notion for event tracking

### Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Ethics submission time | 30+ days | 1-3 days |
| Outside support needed | Yes | No (self-sufficient) |
| Meeting notes delivery | 3-5 days | 10 minutes |

## Talent Tracker - DOJ Criminal Division

**Role:** Project Manager / Business Analyst
**Client:** U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division
**Duration:** 2015-2018
**Recognition:** 2016 DOJ Innovation Award

### Problem

Attorney hiring took 1-2 years due to background investigation delays. Candidates accepted other positions before being cleared. Traditional requirements gathering approaches hadn't yielded a solution.

### What I Did

- Investigated root causes: discovered inaccessible inboxes, poor handoff documentation
- Used agile principles (rapid prototyping, stakeholder testing) instead of traditional requirements gathering
- Built candidate tracking system ("Domino's pizza tracker" style) with status, timelines, and alerts
- Documented complete process in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0)

### Results

- Background clearance times reduced from 1-2 years to under 90 days
- Won 2016 DOJ Innovation Award
- Contract saved and grew to company's largest

## Hanover Research - Revenue Operations Function

**Role:** Business Research Manager (created the role)
**Company:** Hanover Research
**Duration:** 2012-2015

### Problem

Sales reps lacked research expertise to scope projects. Researchers were pulled into sales support, reducing capacity. Long sales cycles (120 days) and low conversion rates (7%).

### What I Did

- Created the Business Research Manager function: sales engineer available to sales team
- Built process, methodology, and templates for sales engineering
- Grew team from 1 to 4
- Designed 90-day training curriculum with SMART outcomes and assessments

### Results

| Metric | Before | After | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Average sales cycle | 120 days | 78 days | 2 years |
| Conversion rate | 7% | 9.5% | 2 years |

Researchers freed to focus on research. Consistent proposal quality across sales team.
