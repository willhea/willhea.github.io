Summary: I needed a place to play and share my thoughts. 
---

This website is a public space for my musings and projects. I love to write, but I've been reluctant to share my thoughts publicly. I'm hoping this site will push me to do so more often, invite critique, and improve my skills. 

If history is any indication, I'll probably give up, but we'll see. I think this is the 3rd or 4th version of a personal website. Hopefully this one will stick. 

# Prior Attempts at a Personal Site
My first personal website was financeidiot.com (no longer active). I wrote a few posts there when I was into the [financial indepence retire early (FIRE) movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement). I felt insecure posting about financial topics (hence the self-deprecating name) and after 2-3 posts, I didn't have anything new to say. A financial strategy that boils down to: (1) high income, (2) low expenses, (3) low-cost index funds, and (4) waiting doesn't require regular updates. The [Mad Fientist](https://www.madfientist.com/) and [Finance Buff](https://thefinancebuff.com/) have already written what I would say better than I would could. 

After financeidiot fell by the wayside, I lost interest in having a public presence until I started sharing Notion guides I'd written with friends and colleagues. I wished I had a public place to share that documentation and while public publishing in Notion can be effective, it did not scratch the itch. 

Around the same time, I took a strong interest in Replit and python coding. I completed the [Replit 100 Days of code](https://blog.replit.com/100-days-of-code) python course in its entirety. 

I vibecoded willhea.com 2-3 different ways in Replit. The final version looked really great too! The problem was that I didn't use it for anything. I wasn't writing and it was an endless set of tweaks to make a perfect website with... nothing in it. 


# My Goals
1. Have Fun
2.
