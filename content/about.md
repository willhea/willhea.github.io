![Will Hea](/images/headshot.png#floatright)

I embed with teams, build systems for visibility and accountability, and leave behind infrastructure that outlasts me.

## What I Do

I lead teams to quickly identify, test, iterate, and solve the most important product, operations, sales, and process obstacles for recurring revenue business models. My clients range from startups to the federal government. I bring an analytical, transparent, and collaborative approach to problem solving.

**Key themes across my work:**

- **Building operational foundations:** I create visibility, connect systems, and build processes that scale
- **Revenue-focused:** Every decision framed around how the business makes money
- **Cross-system integration:** Connecting disconnected tools to create a single source of truth
- **Regulated environments:** HIPAA, SOC II, NIST 853, Congressional ethics, federal contracting
