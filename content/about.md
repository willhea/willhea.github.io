I lead from the front: working alongside teams to build the dashboards, reporting, and operational systems that make everyone's work visible, including mine.

## What I Do

I design and build operational systems that create visibility, accountability, and better decisions. I work alongside teams in the data and technical tools: building dashboards, querying databases, and using Python and AI to create the reporting and automation that drives execution. Most ops leaders stay at the strategy level. I prefer to be in the work with the team.

**Key themes across my work:**

- **Data-driven accountability:** I build shared scoreboards so everyone can see the goals, the metrics, and the progress, starting with my own. Leaders create accountability by being accountable first.
- **Primary sources first:** I go to the data, the system, the vendor, the customer, and I build the reporting so the whole team has the same access and context.
- **Startup to federal:** I've built operations at seed-stage startups and managed programs for DOJ, DOE, and Operation Warp Speed. The specifics change; the approach transfers.
- **Regulated environments:** HIPAA, SOC II, NIST 853, Congressional ethics, federal contracting

## Selected Work

**Operation Warp Speed (2020-2023):** Primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine monitoring. Managed $20M+ annual contract. Reported to OWS federal leadership, worked with U.S. generals and high level contacts at CVS, Pfizer, Walmart, Walgreens. Received Letter of Commendation from General Gustave Perna and recognition from President Biden.

**Phin Security (2024-2025):** Built Python/Looker Studio financial reporting system that unified four data sources into real-time dashboards. First accurate churn, revenue, and growth data in company history. Reduced delinquent invoices from 30% to 0%, recovered $80K+ in bad debt.

**DOJ Criminal Division (2015-2018):** Project manager for Talent Tracker, which reduced attorney background clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days. Won 2016 DOJ Innovation Award. Grew the contract to the company's second largest.

**Department of Energy (2019):** Took over a ServiceNow project at DOE and achieved ATO approval in under 5 months while reducing staffing costs 75%.

## Background

I've worked across government contracting (AE Strategies, Accenture Federal Services), startups (Controlant, Phin Security, Commonwealth Joe), and my own companies (Skeptical Consulting, [Skeptical Labs](https://skepticallabs.com)). I've held titles including CEO, Vice President, Director of Operations, and Project Manager. I hold PMP, A-CSM, CSPO, and SAFe Agilist certifications.

Education: MA and BA in International Studies from American University's School of International Service.

## What I'm Looking For

I do my best work in environments where goals are explicit, key metrics are visible to the people responsible for them, and I own the approach to delivering results. Give me a clear target, the autonomy to choose the tools and methods, and direct access to the data, and I'll build the systems to get there.

I'm looking for operations leadership roles or consulting engagements where I design and build alongside the team, not execute someone else's playbook from a distance.

## Outside of Work

Ultimate frisbee, fly fishing, Dungeons & Dragons, and golf.
