I walk into dysfunction, build systems to create data visibility, and use that data to drive decisions.

## What I Do

I lead teams to quickly identify, test, iterate, and solve the most important product, operations, sales, and process obstacles for recurring revenue business models. My clients range from startups to the federal government. I bring an analytical, transparent, and collaborative approach to problem solving.

**Key themes across my work:**

- **Operational chaos to systems:** I inherit messes, figure out what's broken, build visibility, and fix it
- **Revenue-focused:** Every decision framed around how the business makes money
- **Cross-system integration:** Connecting disconnected tools to create a single source of truth
- **Regulated environments:** HIPAA, SOC II, NIST 853, Congressional ethics, federal contracting

## Selected Work

**Operation Warp Speed (2020-2023):** Primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine monitoring. Managed $20M+ annual contract. Reported to OWS federal leadership, worked with U.S. generals and high level contacts at CVS, Pfizer, Walmart, Walgreens. Received Letter of Commendation from General Gustave Perna and recognition from President Biden.

**Phin Security (2024-2025):** Inherited four disconnected financial systems with no integration. Built Python/Looker Studio reporting that gave the company its first accurate churn, cancellation, and revenue data. Reduced delinquent invoices from 30% to 0%, recovered $80K+ in bad debt, and identified the pricing and churn problems blocking growth.

**DOJ Criminal Division (2015-2018):** Project manager for Talent Tracker, which reduced attorney background clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days. Won 2016 DOJ Innovation Award. Saved a failing contract and grew it to the company's second largest contract.

**Department of Energy (2019):** Inherited ServiceNow project 12 months behind schedule with almost no work completed. Rebuilt team, served as Product Manager, achieved ATO approval in under 5 months while reducing staffing costs 75%.
