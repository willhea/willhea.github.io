  <section><p>Hi! I'm Will! This is my personal website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.</p>
<p>I've worked across various environments, from running my own solo LLC (Skeptical Consulting) to contributing at VC-backed startups (Phin Security, Commonwealth Joe), to government contracting. My background spans physical products (Controlant, Commonwealth Joe), software (Controlant, Phin Security), and services (AE Strategies, Accenture Federal Services). I have held roles including CEO, Head of Finance, Head of HR, product manager, and project manager, among others. I led Skeptical Consulting LLC as CEO until its sale in June 2021. I have worked as a federal contractor with agencies including the DOJ, DOE, and HHS, where I played a key role in the tracking and safety of the Pfizer COVID-19 in the US for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Warp_Speed">Operation Warp Speed</a>.</p>
<p>I want to work on the most interesting problems, with the best people, all the time. </p>
<p>In my free time, I play ultimate frisbee, flyfish, and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons with my friends.</p>
<p>I built this website using <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> using <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> and hosted on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site">Github Pages</a>. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/willhea/willhea.github.io">github repo</a>.</p></section>
