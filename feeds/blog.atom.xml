This post details the build of this site that meets all of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Goals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals for the infrastructure for this site are: 
1. Write content and posts in Markdown format
2. Create a static site from the Markdown files that loads quickly
3. Rely on a maintained, documented, open source backend with a preference for Python
4. Use cheap/free hosting
5. Privacy friendly tracking &amp;amp; analytics
6. Customize the site in Python&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Selecting a Build&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like cheating, but to find a solution, I prompted &lt;a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/"&gt;Perplexity&lt;/a&gt;. It recommended: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hosting: 
- &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://www.hostinger.com/1"&gt;Hostinger&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://www.netlify.com/"&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://vercel.com/"&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt; immediately stood out to me by being free and one fewer service I need to setup and maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static Site Generator: 
- &lt;a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/"&gt;MkDocs&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;
- &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I perused documentation and site examples and narrowed it down to Nikola and Pelican. Both looked excellent (I may end up trying both in the future), but I went with &lt;strong&gt;Pelican&lt;/strong&gt; because I liked the &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html"&gt;GitHub Pages documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the example sites looked more than good enough for my needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Building&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;Replit&lt;/a&gt;, but I want to build this site in a local environment to work on my coding skills and make it easier to maintain and work on offline. I travel often and frequently don't have strong wifi. I want to be able to write and work on the site at any time with or without an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For deployment, this site works across two GitHub repos, one public and one private. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/willhea/willhea.github.io"&gt;public repo&lt;/a&gt; holds the code for this site. The private repo holds the markdown files, Pelican, and other backend code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a commit is pushed to the main branch of the private repo, it triggers a GitHub Action to run the code and push the outputs of the static site generator into the public repo. The &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html"&gt;Pelican documentation&lt;/a&gt; provides more detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Styling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I adore simple black and white text and websites. It's one of the many reasons I keep coming back to &lt;a href="https://www.notion.com/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;. I block scripts and tracking on my browsers and convert any page I can into a simple reader. I also adore fast load times. I &lt;strong&gt;hate&lt;/strong&gt; sites with auto-playing videos and other cruft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the default simple theme and made some CSS modifications with the help of AI. The current styling is similar to what I built on my homebrew Replit site. The look and feel is heavily inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.mattleaverton.com/"&gt;Matt Leaverton's personal site&lt;/a&gt; that also runs on Pelican. Matt, we've never met, but I like your style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tracking &amp;amp; Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not writing this blog for pageviews. Still, it's useful to know who accesses this site, how often, and what they view. I don't need detailed information on every user. The three primary options I considered were: 
1. &lt;a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/"&gt;GoatCounter&lt;/a&gt;
2. &lt;a href="https://plausible.io/"&gt;Plausible Analytics&lt;/a&gt;
3. &lt;a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/info?authuser=0"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; (free version)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is interesting because it would be a great opportunity to play with a tool I would use elsewhere. At the same time, I favor privacy, I think Google's tracking is excessive and invasive, and I block those trackers as a user in my own browsing. If it would annoy me, I'm not going to do it to my users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with GoatCounter because it's free for my use case and &lt;a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/help/start"&gt;dead simple to install&lt;/a&gt; and maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the setup so far and it's been extremely easy to update and maintain. It's inspired me to write, so it's already doing its job!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"/></entry><entry><title>Why willhea.com?</title><link href="https://willhea.github.io/why_willhea.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2025-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Will Hea</name></author><id>tag:willhea.github.io,2025-09-03:/why_willhea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I need a place to play and share my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This website is a public space for my musings and projects. I love to write, and I am a prolific producer of internal documents, guides, and memos. However, I've been reluctant to share my thoughts publicly. I'm hoping this site will push me to do so more often, invite critique, and improve my skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Goals for This Site&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have Fun&lt;/strong&gt;: I have a lot of passions and a lot of opinions. I want this site to be me and I want to have fun with it. If I want to write about D&amp;amp;D or &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/"&gt;Brotato&lt;/a&gt;, I will. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write and Think Better&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm a private person and I think that's often a good thing. At the same time, it can limit my ability to learn and interact with others. I want to create an obligation to share publicly, receive criticism, and grow. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make New Connections&lt;/strong&gt;: When I get bored, I like to read  &lt;a href="https://lobste.rs/"&gt;lobste.rs&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the posts come from personal sites and I follow the authors from there. I'm a peculiar person, I'd like to meet other peculiar people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Prior Attempts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If history is any indication, I'll probably give up, but maybe not! I think this is my 3rd or 4th version of a personal website. Hopefully this one will stick. Here's what happened with the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;financeidiot.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first personal website was financeidiot.com (no longer active). I wrote a few posts there when I was into the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement"&gt;financial indepence retire early (FIRE) movement&lt;/a&gt;. I was interested in FIRE, but I felt insecure posting about financial topics (hence the self-deprecating name) and after 2-3 posts, I didn't have anything new to say. A financial strategy that boils down to: (1) high income, (2) low expenses, (3) low-cost index funds, and (4) waiting doesn't require regular updates. The &lt;a href="https://www.madfientist.com/"&gt;Mad Fientist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/"&gt;Finance Buff&lt;/a&gt; have already written what I would say better than I could. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;skepticalconsulting.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks, I tried to start writing at skepticalconsulting.com, but I gave up almost immediately. The intent was to drum up business for Skeptical Consulting, but I didn't have anything to say other than, "I would like your business, please." Other demands in the business took up my time and I lost interest in public writing entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vibe-coded willhea.com&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After financeidiot and Skeptical Consulting, I lost interest in having a public presence until I started sharing guides and standard operating procedures I had written with friends through Notion public pages. I wished I had a public place to share that documentation and while sharing Notion can be effective, it did not have the same feeling of commitment as publishing on a website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, I took a strong interest in &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;Replit&lt;/a&gt; and Python. I completed the &lt;a href="https://blog.replit.com/100-days-of-code"&gt;Replit 100 Days of code&lt;/a&gt; Python course in full and had a blast! Part of the course required using Flask to setup simple Python websites and when I upgraded to the Replit Core plan, I had a lot of free credits leftover for hosting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the domain name and vibe-coded willhea.com 3 different ways in Replit. I knew I wanted to write in Notion or as Markdown files because that format has always felt easiest to write in. After a few days in Replit, the final version looked exactly how I wanted! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also overkill for my needs: posts were stored in Markdown and in a PostgreSQL database. There was an admin page to view analytics, an editing page for adding posts, and a resume editor. The problem was that I didn't use it for anything. I wasn't writing and it was an endless set of tweaks to make a perfect website with... nothing in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to Markdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing my Replit site for a final time, I realized that I need to write, I prefer writing in Markdown, and no amount of fancy code is going to replace me sitting down and typing. If I can solve the problem of writing, I can figure out everything else later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I've built this site using the &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; static site generator. &lt;a href="https://willhea.github.io/how_i_built_this_site.html"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; provides more detail on how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What's Different This Time?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not a betting man, but if this has failed a few times before, why is it going to succeed this time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it probably won't. Second, I think this time might be different for three reasons:
1. &lt;strong&gt;Low Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;: If no one reads this site, I'm ok with that. This one is for me. 
2. &lt;strong&gt;High Energy&lt;/strong&gt;:  I've been filling up on creative energy for a few years and I haven't had an outlet. Just writing this article is making me feel better. 
3. &lt;strong&gt;Empty Space&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm taking a sabbatical and have plenty of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see what happens. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"/></entry></feed>
