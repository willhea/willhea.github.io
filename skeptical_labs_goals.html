    <h1>Skeptical Labs LLC Goals, Structure, & Principles</h1>
  </header>
  <section><p><em>I've written guides on how I structured my prior LLCs. This is my latest version with the services and structure I use and recommend for Skeptical Labs, LLC. This is not advice. Structure your business to fit your needs.</em></p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I’ve started Skeptical Labs, LLC as a continuation of the spirit of Skeptical Consulting, LLC. I seek to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solve the most interesting problems<br>
For the best clients<br>
With the most talented people<br>
To live the lives we choose<br>
All the time  </p>
<p>— Skeptical Consulting’s Purpose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To meet these goals, I enter into consulting contracts with clients. Since Skeptical Consulting LLC has closed, I have worked ad hoc as a sole proprietor. I’ve reached a point that I’d like to formally separate my work from me as an individual. </p>
<p>From founding, selling, and dissolving Skeptical Consulting, LLC, I have learned: </p>
<ul>
<li>Starting and maintaining an LLC is relatively inexpensive ($50 - $500 per year)</li>
<li>Changing from a Solo LLC to an LLC with employees or reverting back from an S Corp is far more annoying and difficult than starting a separate LLC.</li>
<li>I have a permanent need for an LLC that can handle miscellaneous and unpredictable income from $0 - $100,000 per year.</li>
<li>If I intend to have a company with employees, S Corp election, and other complications, I should just start another LLC separate from my permanent LLC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skeptical Labs, LLC will be my permanent LLC for miscellaneous income. If I reach a point where I am generating enough income to justify an S Corp election, I will found a separate company, migrate applicable work to that company, and keep Skeptical Labs as the permanent LLC. </p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>I need a permanent, single member LLC to perform these functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protect personal income by separating personal and business assets and data</li>
<li>Serve as a general purpose business structure until I find a reason to run a separate business. The threshold for founding another business will be $100,000 per year in renewing revenue.</li>
<li>Operate as inexpensively and efficiently as possible to allow for years with little or no side income</li>
<li>Maintain a Solo 401k in perpetuity</li>
</ol>
<h1>Operating Principles and Rules</h1>
<p>To meet the goals, the company shall abide by the following principles and rules.</p>
<h2>Principle 1: Protect Personal Assets First</h2>
<ol>
<li>Skeptical Labs may not take actions that risk personal assets in favor of business assets. This means: <ol>
<li>Use a <a href="https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/">registered agent</a> for filings and public information. </li>
<li>Separate personal vs. business assets (financial accounts, document storage, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Skeptical Labs must operate with minimum required permits, insurance, and other requirements.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Principle 2: Optimize for Permanent Operation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Skeptical Labs shall operate as if it will continue to run for 30 - 40 years.</li>
<li>Skeptical Labs shall be organized simply and inexpensively through a small number of stable and reliable vendors: <ol>
<li>Registered Agent (<a href="https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/">Northwest Registered Agent</a>): Annual filings, maintain privacy. </li>
<li>Email Service (<a href="https://mail.proton.me/">Protonmail</a>): Free through personal paid plan</li>
<li>Office Suite (<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> &amp; <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace Free Account</a>): Document storage, sharing, etc. </li>
<li>Website (<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html">Pelican</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare DNS</a>): Basic website and contact information</li>
<li>Primary Bank (<a href="https://mercury.com/">Mercury</a>): Checking account, invoices, wire transfers (international and domestic), debit cards</li>
<li>Secondary Bank (<a href="https://www.fidelity.com/open-account/fidelity-account-for-businesses">Fidelity</a>): Competitive money market rate for cash holdings. Backup account.</li>
<li>Solo 401k (<a href="https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/small-business/self-employed-401k/overview">Fidelity</a>): Reduce taxes, save for retirement, allow for backdoor Roth IRA contributions in perpetuity.</li>
<li>Accounting (Spreadsheet with upgrade to <a href="https://quickbooks.intuit.com/online/simple-start/">Quickbooks Simple Start</a> when needed): Track expenses and income.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Skeptical Labs shall not file as an S Corp. If the business is successful enough, I will create a separate LLC and migrate applicable contracts to that LLC. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Principle 3: Keep It Simple (KISS)</h2>
<ol>
<li>No more than 80% billable hours (32 hours per week). Reserve 20% of time for business development.</li>
<li>Use vendors for their assigned roles. Even if it is slower and more expensive, the business will be more stable, reliable, and consistent. </li>
<li>Use simple and reliable contract structures, such as flat fee or hourly contracts. </li>
<li>Make invoices and payments easy and fast. Net 15 - 30 day terms. Accept credit card payments.</li>
<li>No employees. Skeptical Labs shall never have employees and will forever remain a single member LLC.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to avoid overcomplicated structures and costs that slowed down Skeptical Consulting. I believe this structure is simple, lightweight, easy to maintain, and easy to upgrade if and when it is necessary. When I find a compelling business model, I'll form a new company. </p></section>
