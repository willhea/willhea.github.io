[{"content":"My parents are avid golfers. Eight years ago, I saw how much fun they were having and how beautiful the courses were. I resolved to learn how to play so I could play with them.\nBack at home, I searched for \u0026ldquo;golf courses near me\u0026rdquo; and, after the sticker shock of Arlington\u0026rsquo;s private courses, searched for \u0026ldquo;public affordable golf courses near me.\u0026rdquo; That returned a much more reasonable set of options. The closest course with golf lessons was East Potomac. I signed up for the Get Golf Ready 101 Class and never looked back.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still not a good golfer, but I\u0026rsquo;m much better and more consistent striking the ball. I can now reasonably play and keep pace with a group, including my parents, which was my goal. I also learned that golf, when you reach a minimum threshold of skill and can maintain the right attitude, is fun! It\u0026rsquo;s been a great way to get out of the house, get fresh air, have fun, and make and maintain friendships. As I\u0026rsquo;m getting further into middle age, I greatly appreciate a consistent and affordable way to be with friends that isn\u0026rsquo;t going to a bar.\nNow, I golf or practice at East Potomac about once every two weeks, even in winter. During the spring and summer, my friends and I will play there up to three times per week. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten many individual lessons with the East Potomac instructors. My wife picked up the game too and we golf together! I\u0026rsquo;ve spent more time and money at East Potomac over the years than I care to count, but I consider money well spent at exceptional value.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been saddened to see that the National Links Trust\u0026rsquo;s (NLT) lease with the National Park Service has been canceled. As a regular of East Potomac, I cannot speak for the Langston or Rock Creek courses, the difference in quality of management and facilities before and after the National Links course has been night and day. I feel the NLT cares a lot about a high value, affordable, and accessible municipal golf experience for the DC area and they have delivered. Since taking over:\nNLT added Toptracer shot tracking and heating to the lower covered range bays, allowing comfortable practice in winter. At $20 for 132 balls, East Potomac is the most affordable place to practice by far. NLT substantially improved the Red Course, especially the water hazard on holes 6 and 7. Before it was fixed, it had become a shallow mud pit. NLT renovated the East Potomac miniature golf course. I don\u0026rsquo;t play mini golf there, but I see families playing there whenever I go to golf. Prior to the renovation, it was empty. General greenskeeping improvements. All courses at East Potomac have been better conditions than under prior management. This was the most noticeable and immediate change when NLT took over as stewards of the courses. Now, this isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that the facilities and courses are on par with the other courses in the area. The Fairfax, VA courses have nicer greenskeeping, but they don\u0026rsquo;t have comparable range facilities near DC. The private courses are far and away nicer in every way, but they are also expensive and exclusive. The DC municipal courses are the only game in town for budget golfers living in or around DC. I especially enjoy East Potomac\u0026rsquo;s three practice holes, rare for the area.\nRight now, the worst part about East Potomac is the dumping of material from the White House\u0026rsquo;s East Wing renovation on the White Course, which is not really NLT\u0026rsquo;s fault.\nEast Potomac is my home course. I started going there because it\u0026rsquo;s close and cheap. I continue to go there because I love the instructors, and the Toptracer range and practice holes are the best practice tools for the money in the DC area. I worry that whoever takes over from NLT won\u0026rsquo;t maintain the same commitment to affordable, accessible golf. If East Potomac weren\u0026rsquo;t available to me, I would definitely golf less.\n","permalink":"https://willhea.com/posts/national-links-trust/","summary":"National Links Trust has been an excellent steward of DC\u0026rsquo;s public golf courses, and I\u0026rsquo;m saddened to see their lease cancelled.","title":"In Praise of National Links Trust"},{"content":"Note: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Invest at your own risk.\nTwo years ago, I sat in a finance meeting walking through our \u0026ldquo;cash management strategy.\u0026rdquo; We were juggling multiple checking accounts, and anything not needed in the next 3 months went to an external advisor who split it across short-term CDs and Treasuries. Gross yield: ~3.5%. Advisor fee: 0.60%. Net: 2.9%.\nAt the same time, money market funds were earning ~4.5%.\nAdding insult to injury, our cash was locked up and required careful handholding to manage liquidity. I suggested we just use a money market fund. After a short debate, we stuck with the plan, hoping the advisor would eventually beat the market. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth a battle over a few thousand dollars a year, but it still felt silly to tie up cash for a lower return when money market funds exist.\nFast forward to today when I set up Skeptical Labs LLC, I found a buffet of business \u0026ldquo;savings-like\u0026rdquo; products. Each has its own flavor and eligibility requirements. Most of them should be ignored in favor of a simple money market fund via a basic business brokerage account.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick sample:\nProvider Product Interest Rate1 Asset Requirement Mercury Treasury 3.6%–4.06% $250,000 Ramp Treasury 4.1% $25,0002 Invesco FUGXX Money Market Fund 4.02% $1,000 JP Morgan MJTXX Money Market Fund 3.65% $1,000 Fidelity SPAXX Money Market Fund 3.78% $1 Vanguard VMFXX Federal Money Market Fund 4.04% $3,000 At first glance, Ramp and Mercury look competitive with money market funds—but under the hood, they\u0026rsquo;re mostly wrappers for money market funds. Ramp Treasury is a wrapper for Invesco\u0026rsquo;s Premier U.S. Government Money Portfolio (FUGXX). Mercury primarily uses JPMorgan\u0026rsquo;s U.S. Treasury Plus Money Market Fund and may hold other fixed-income securities at its discretion (Mercury Advisory LLC, Wrap Fee Program Brochure, Page 4). Mercury also charges 0.15%–0.60% in fees depending on balance size (same source).\nTo be clear: I like Ramp and Mercury. Their banking, spend management, and cards are excellent. If you value automation and qualify for their treasury products, they\u0026rsquo;re perfectly reasonable, even with fees.\nBut if your goal is straightforward: keep cash liquid and earn a fair yield, you can open a basic business brokerage account at a reputable firm (Fidelity, Vanguard, or Interactive Brokers) and select a competitive money market fund. No or low minimums, no fees, and high liquidity.\nIf you want to squeeze a few extra basis points, use a free tool like moneymarket.fun to compare yields. Just remember: there are more important things to do than chase an extra 10 bps on idle cash. Keep it simple. Use a money market fund.\nInterest rate as of 10/7/2025. 7-Day SEC yield provided for money market funds.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nRamp requires $25,000 in cash to open an account (eligibility requirements).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://willhea.com/posts/money-market/","summary":"Simple, easy, accessible cash with a fair return.","title":"Just use money market funds"},{"content":"If the default is death, stay alive.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent half of my career and most of the past five years working at venture-capital-backed startups. The companies are not profitable. They rely on infusions from investors to keep going. Success is building a business model that eventually escapes the unprofitability trap, rewarding investors and employees. Until that happens, the business is slowly (or quickly!) dying, burning its reserves (runway) toward zero.\nThe Default is Death Working at an unprofitable startup is uniquely different from other businesses in that the default is death. Every day, the business draws closer to its end. Business as usual is unacceptable because it results in failure. As a company and employee, you are forced to accept more risk to stay alive.\nThis environment is terrifying and, if not managed, a source of existential dread as the Sword of Damocles draws ever nearer. It\u0026rsquo;s also exciting! You have to take risks to survive, so a well-run startup will operate faster and more aggressively than a profitable business.\nCash vs. Time The two most important resources in a startup are cash and time. They\u0026rsquo;re so tightly coupled they\u0026rsquo;re almost the same thing. A company with $1.2M in the bank burning $100k/month has 12 months of runway. Cut burn to $50k/month and runway becomes 24 months. Increase revenue by $50k/month and you get the same result. The game is extending runway until you reach profitability. You won\u0026rsquo;t grow with $0 in expenses, but you\u0026rsquo;ll die quickly if you spend your reserves without results; balancing cost and time is the core prioritization tension.\nPrioritize Against Runway So how do you prioritize at an unprofitable startup? The general rule I follow is this:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t work on anything with a timeline longer than your runway UNLESS it unlocks the next fundraise.\nIn other words, if you will die before you get the benefit and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t help your next fundraise, don\u0026rsquo;t do it.\nDoes this mean that all long-term projects should be abandoned? No. But the vast majority of everyone\u0026rsquo;s time and resources should be hyper-focused on what needs to be accomplished to enable the next fundraise.\nWhile this advice may seem obvious, it can be difficult to apply in day-to-day operations. Every startup I\u0026rsquo;ve worked at has struggled with these decisions. Consider the following questions for a company with 6 months of runway:\nShould we hire a marketing guru who will help us generate more revenue 12 months from now? Answer: Don\u0026rsquo;t hire. Should we prepay for next year\u0026rsquo;s software spend to lock in a discount? Answer: Don\u0026rsquo;t prepay. Should we focus on building a new product that won\u0026rsquo;t earn revenue for 12 months, or growing revenue from the current product right now? Answer: Short-term revenue (you could argue that progress on a new product could help with fundraising now). In a vacuum, each alternative seems reasonable. There is work that needs to get done so we need to hire employees. We can save money next year by prepaying. But within the context of runway, these are all decisions that hurt us in the short term with little or no guaranteed benefit.\nI purchased Anrok while I was Director of Operations at Phin Security and I loved it (case study here). What isn\u0026rsquo;t in that case study: I deliberately delayed buying any sales tax solution until we completed a fundraise and extended our runway. Sales tax compliance, while important. It didn\u0026rsquo;t contribute to the next raise and would have been, at best, a distraction and, at worst, a drain on scarce resources. Once the fundraise closed, our runway and expectations expanded to include compliance and I moved ahead.\nGood decisions made at the wrong time are bad decisions. At a startup, every choice must be evaluated in the context of revenue, profitability, and runway. If your work doesn\u0026rsquo;t extend runway or unlock the next fundraise, you\u0026rsquo;re working on the wrong thing. Stop, reflect, and reprioritize.\n","permalink":"https://willhea.com/posts/timeline-vs-runway/","summary":"Don\u0026rsquo;t plan beyond your runway.","title":"Your timeline is shorter than your runway"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve written guides on how I structured my prior LLCs. This is my latest version with the services and structure I use and recommend for Skeptical Labs, LLC. This is not advice. Structure your business to fit your needs.\nBackground I\u0026rsquo;ve started Skeptical Labs, LLC as a continuation of the spirit of Skeptical Consulting, LLC. I seek to:\nSolve the most interesting problems For the best clients With the most talented people To live the lives we choose All the time\n— Skeptical Consulting\u0026rsquo;s Purpose\nTo meet these goals, I enter into consulting contracts with clients. Since Skeptical Consulting LLC has closed, I have worked ad hoc as a sole proprietor. I\u0026rsquo;ve reached a point that I\u0026rsquo;d like to formally separate my work from me as an individual.\nFrom founding, selling, and dissolving Skeptical Consulting, LLC, I have learned:\nStarting and maintaining an LLC is relatively inexpensive ($50 - $500 per year) Changing from a Solo LLC to an LLC with employees or reverting back from an S Corp is far more annoying and difficult than starting a separate LLC. I have a permanent need for an LLC that can handle miscellaneous and unpredictable income from $0 - $100,000 per year. If I intend to have a company with employees, S Corp election, and other complications, I should just start another LLC separate from my permanent LLC. Skeptical Labs, LLC will be my permanent LLC for miscellaneous income. If I reach a point where I am generating enough income to justify an S Corp election, I will found a separate company, migrate applicable work to that company, and keep Skeptical Labs as the permanent LLC.\nGoals I need a permanent, single member LLC to perform these functions:\nProtect personal income by separating personal and business assets and data Serve as a general purpose business structure until I find a reason to run a separate business. The threshold for founding another business will be $100,000 per year in renewing revenue. Operate as inexpensively and efficiently as possible to allow for years with little or no side income Maintain a Solo 401k in perpetuity Operating Principles and Rules To meet the goals, the company shall abide by the following principles and rules.\nPrinciple 1: Protect Personal Assets First Skeptical Labs may not take actions that risk personal assets in favor of business assets. This means: Use a registered agent for filings and public information. Separate personal vs. business assets (financial accounts, document storage, etc.) Skeptical Labs must operate with minimum required permits, insurance, and other requirements. Principle 2: Optimize for Permanent Operation Skeptical Labs shall operate as if it will continue to run for 30 - 40 years. Skeptical Labs shall be organized simply and inexpensively through a small number of stable and reliable vendors: Registered Agent (Northwest Registered Agent): Annual filings, maintain privacy. Email Service (Protonmail): Free through personal paid plan Office Suite (LibreOffice \u0026amp; Google Workspace Free Account): Document storage, sharing, etc. Website (Namecheap, Github Pages, Hugo, Cloudflare DNS): Basic website and contact information Primary Bank (Mercury): Checking account, invoices, wire transfers (international and domestic), debit cards Secondary Bank (Fidelity): Competitive money market rate for cash holdings. Backup account. Solo 401k (Fidelity): Reduce taxes, save for retirement, allow for backdoor Roth IRA contributions in perpetuity. Accounting (Spreadsheet with upgrade to Quickbooks Simple Start when needed): Track expenses and income. Skeptical Labs shall not file as an S Corp. If the business is successful enough, I will create a separate LLC and migrate applicable contracts to that LLC. Principle 3: Keep It Simple (KISS) No more than 80% billable hours (32 hours per week). Reserve 20% of time for business development. Use vendors for their assigned roles. Even if it is slower and more expensive, the business will be more stable, reliable, and consistent. Use simple and reliable contract structures, such as flat fee or hourly contracts. Make invoices and payments easy and fast. Net 15 - 30 day terms. Accept credit card payments. No employees. Skeptical Labs shall never have employees and will forever remain a single member LLC. I want to avoid overcomplicated structures and costs that slowed down Skeptical Consulting. I believe this structure is simple, lightweight, easy to maintain, and easy to upgrade if and when it is necessary. When I find a compelling business model, I\u0026rsquo;ll form a new company.\n","permalink":"https://willhea.com/posts/skeptical-labs-goals/","summary":"Goals and operating principles for Skeptical Labs LLC.","title":"Skeptical Labs LLC Goals, Structure, \u0026 Principles"},{"content":"In a prior post, I mentioned I wanted to create a personal site that was simple, low cost or free, easy to maintain, and relied on open source projects. This post details the build of this site that meets all of those goals.\nNote: I\u0026rsquo;ve migrated to Hugo from Pelican. This post is updated accordingly.\nMy Goals My goals for the infrastructure for this site are:\nWrite content and posts in Markdown format Create a static site from the Markdown files that loads quickly Rely on a maintained, documented, open source backend Use cheap/free hosting Privacy friendly tracking \u0026amp; analytics Simple customization Selecting a Build For hosting, I chose GitHub Pages because it\u0026rsquo;s free and one fewer service to setup and maintain.\nFor the static site generator, I chose Hugo with the PaperMod theme. Hugo is fast, well-documented, and has excellent theme support. PaperMod provides a clean, minimal design with dark mode support out of the box. Note: I formerly used Pelican with a custom theme.\nBuilding This site works across two GitHub repos, one public and one private. The public repo holds the generated static site. The private repo holds the markdown files, Hugo config, and themes.\nWhen a commit is pushed to the main branch of the private repo, it triggers a GitHub Action to build the site and push the outputs to the public repo.\nStyling I adore simple black and white text and websites. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the many reasons I keep coming back to Notion. I block scripts and tracking on my browsers and convert any page I can into a simple reader. I also adore fast load times. I hate sites with auto-playing videos and other cruft.\nPaperMod\u0026rsquo;s default styling aligns well with these preferences. Clean, minimal, fast.\nTracking \u0026amp; Metrics I\u0026rsquo;m not writing this blog for pageviews. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s useful to know who accesses this site, how often, and what they view. I don\u0026rsquo;t need detailed information on every user.\nI went with GoatCounter because it\u0026rsquo;s free for my use case and dead simple to install and maintain.\nI like the setup so far and it\u0026rsquo;s been extremely easy to update and maintain.

I love to write, and I am a prolific producer of internal documents, guides, and memos. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve been reluctant to share my thoughts publicly. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping this site will push me to do so more often, invite critique, and improve my skills.\nMy Goals for This Site Have Fun: I have a lot of passions and a lot of opinions. I want this site to be me and I want to have fun with it. If I want to write about D\u0026amp;D or Brotato, I will. Write and Think Better: I\u0026rsquo;m a private person and I think that\u0026rsquo;s often a good thing. At the same time, it can limit my ability to learn and interact with others. I want to create an obligation to share publicly, receive criticism, and grow. Make New Connections: When I get bored, I like to read lobste.rs. Many of the posts come from personal sites and I follow the authors from there. I\u0026rsquo;m a peculiar person, I\u0026rsquo;d like to meet other peculiar people. Prior Attempts If history is any indication, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably give up, but maybe not! I think this is my 3rd or 4th version of a personal website. Hopefully this one will stick. Here\u0026rsquo;s what happened with the others.\nfinanceidiot.com My first personal website was financeidiot.com (no longer active). I wrote a few posts there when I was into the financial indepence retire early (FIRE) movement. I was interested in FIRE, but I felt insecure posting about financial topics (hence the self-deprecating name) and after 2-3 posts, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything new to say. A financial strategy that boils down to: (1) high income, (2) low expenses, (3) low-cost index funds, and (4) waiting doesn\u0026rsquo;t require regular updates. The Mad Fientist and Finance Buff have already written what I would say better than I could.\nskepticalconsulting.com For a few weeks, I tried to start writing at skepticalconsulting.com, but I gave up almost immediately. The intent was to drum up business for Skeptical Consulting, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to say other than, \u0026ldquo;I would like your business, please.\u0026rdquo; Other demands in the business took up my time and I lost interest in public writing entirely.\nVibe-coded willhea.com After financeidiot and Skeptical Consulting, I lost interest in having a public presence until I started sharing guides and standard operating procedures I had written with friends through Notion public pages. I wished I had a public place to share that documentation and while sharing Notion can be effective, it did not have the same feeling of commitment as publishing on a website.\nAround the same time, I took a strong interest in Replit and Python. I completed the Replit 100 Days of code Python course in full and had a blast! Part of the course required using Flask to setup simple Python websites and when I upgraded to the Replit Core plan, I had a lot of free credits leftover for hosting.\nI bought the domain name and vibe-coded willhea.com 3 different ways in Replit. I knew I wanted to write in Notion or as Markdown files because that format has always felt easiest to write in. After a few days in Replit, the final version looked exactly how I wanted!\nIt was also overkill for my needs: posts were stored in Markdown and in a PostgreSQL database. There was an admin page to view analytics, an editing page for adding posts, and a resume editor. The problem was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t use it for anything. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t writing and it was an endless set of tweaks to make a perfect website with\u0026hellip; nothing in it.\nBack to Markdown After reviewing my Replit site for a final time, I realized that I need to write, I prefer writing in Markdown, and no amount of fancy code is going to replace me sitting down and typing. If I can solve the problem of writing, I can figure out everything else later.\nTo that end, I\u0026rsquo;ve built this site using the Hugo static site generator. This post provides more detail on how. Note: I previously built this site with Pelican.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Different This Time? I\u0026rsquo;m not a betting man, but if this has failed a few times before, why is it going to succeed this time?\nFirst, it probably won\u0026rsquo;t. Second, I think this time might be different for three reasons:\nLow Pressure: If no one reads this site, I\u0026rsquo;m ok with that. This one is for me. High Energy: I\u0026rsquo;ve been filling up on creative energy for a few years and I haven\u0026rsquo;t had an outlet. Just writing this article is making me feel better.
