Controlant had the technology but no U.S. presence or government contracting experience.\nWhat I Did Primary liaison between Controlant (Iceland) and U.S. Government stakeholders Product owner translating USG requirements to development team Built and led the U.S. operations team from scratch Managed contract administration: CPARS, DoD payment collection, HHS COR relationship Operated weekly scrum cadence for requirements, testing, and change control Results Successful monitoring of every Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine box in the United States Contract value increased 37.5% in one year Scaled to national operations with a 4-person team through templating and automation Letter of Commendation from General Gustave Perna Recognition from President Biden Phin Security - Financial Systems Rebuild Role: Director of Operations Company: Phin Security, Inc (Seed-stage cybersecurity startup) Duration: 2024-2025\nProblem Four disconnected financial systems (Quickbooks, Chargebee, Hubspot, internal database) with no integration. Three different billing methods. Books took 2+ months to reconcile. No accurate revenue, churn, or growth data.\nWhat I Did Mapped data flows across all systems, identified discrepancies Built standardized reconciliation process Created Python automation scripts for data extraction Built Looker Studio dashboards for real-time financial reporting Results Metric Before After Book close time 2+ months 3 business days Delinquent invoices 30% 0% Bad debt recovered - $80,000+ Revenue visibility None Real-time dashboards Data revealed broken pricing structure and first-90-day churn as primary growth obstacles, enabling strategic decisions.\nWAPA - FTE Reallocation Decision Process Role: Contract Lead / Project Manager Client: Western Area Power Administration (Department of Energy) Duration: 2020\nProblem Congress sets a fixed FTE cap. Every new hire requires losing an existing position. No transparent way to make these decisions, creating conflict for every vacancy.\nWhat I Did Interviewed leadership across divisions to understand pain points Designed multi-stage decision process: standardized intake, manager endorsement, group review with ranked-choice voting, final approval with cost estimates Ran simulations with historical data to validate the process Trained managers and facilitated initial rounds Results Framework adopted organization-wide for all FTE hiring decisions Still in use today Reduced conflict through transparent, consistent criteria TPN - Congressional Ethics Automation Role: U.S. Director Organization: Transatlantic Policy Network (NGO) Duration: 2025-Present\nProblem Congressional ethics package submissions took 30+ days with outside support. Each event involving Members of Congress required detailed itineraries, cost breakdowns, and multiple approvals.\nWhat I Did Mapped the complete ethics submission workflow Created reusable templates for common submission types Built AI workflows (Claude Code) to draft initial submissions Integrated with Notion for event tracking Results Metric Before After Ethics submission time 30+ days 1-3 days Outside support needed Yes No (self-sufficient) Meeting notes delivery 3-5 days 10 minutes Talent Tracker - DOJ Criminal Division Role: Project Manager / Business Analyst Client: U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Division Duration: 2015-2018 Recognition: 2016 DOJ Innovation Award\nProblem Attorney hiring took 1-2 years due to background investigation delays. Candidates accepted other positions before being cleared. Previous contractor team spent months on requirements gathering without delivering a solution.\nWhat I Did Investigated root causes: discovered inaccessible inboxes, poor handoff documentation Used agile principles (rapid prototyping, stakeholder testing) instead of traditional requirements gathering Built candidate tracking system (“Domino’s pizza tracker” style) with status, timelines, and alerts Documented complete process in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN 2.0) Results Background clearance times reduced from 1-2 years to under 90 days Won 2016 DOJ Innovation Award Contract saved and grew to company’s largest Hanover Research - Revenue Operations Function Role: Business Research Manager (created the role) Company: Hanover Research Duration: 2012-2015\nProblem Sales reps lacked research expertise to scope projects. Researchers were pulled into sales support, reducing capacity. Long sales cycles (120 days) and low conversion rates (7%).\nWhat I Did Created the Business Research Manager function: sales engineer available to sales team Built process, methodology, and templates for sales engineering Grew team from 1 to 4 Designed 90-day training curriculum with SMART outcomes and assessments Results Metric Before After Timeframe Average sales cycle 120 days 78 days 2 years Conversion rate 7% 9.5% 2 years Researchers freed to focus on research.
