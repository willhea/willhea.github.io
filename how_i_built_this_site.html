    <h1>How I Built This Site</h1>
  </header>
  <section><p>In a <a href="https://willhea.github.io/why_willhea.html">prior post</a>, I mentioned I wanted to create a personal site that was simple, low cost or free, easy to maintain, and relied on open source projects with a preference for Python. This post details the build of this site that meets all of those goals.</p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>My goals for the infrastructure for this site are: 
1. Write content and posts in Markdown format
2. Create a static site from the Markdown files that loads quickly
3. Rely on a maintained, documented, open source backend with a preference for Python
4. Use cheap/free hosting
5. Privacy friendly tracking &amp; analytics
6. Customize the site in Python</p>
<h2>Selecting a Build</h2>
<p>It feels like cheating, but to find a solution, I prompted <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>. It recommended: </p>
<p>Hosting: 
- <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">GitHub Pages</a>
- <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/1">Hostinger</a>
- <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>
- <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></p>
<p><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> immediately stood out to me by being free and one fewer service I need to setup and maintain. </p>
<p>Static Site Generator: 
- <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a>
- <a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>
- <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/">Pelican</a></p>
<p>I perused documentation and site examples and narrowed it down to Nikola and Pelican. Both looked excellent (I may end up trying both in the future), but I went with <strong>Pelican</strong> because I liked the <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html">GitHub Pages documentation</a> and the example sites looked more than good enough for my needs. </p>
<h2>Building</h2>
<p>I love <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a>, but I want to build this site in a local environment to work on my coding skills and make it easier to maintain and work on offline. I travel often and frequently don't have strong wifi. I want to be able to write and work on the site at any time with or without an internet connection.</p>
<p>For deployment, this site works across two GitHub repos, one public and one private. The <a href="https://github.com/willhea/willhea.github.io">public repo</a> holds the code for this site. The private repo holds the markdown files, Pelican, and other backend code.</p>
<p>When a commit is pushed to the main branch of the private repo, it triggers a GitHub Action to run the code and push the outputs of the static site generator into the public repo. The <a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html">Pelican documentation</a> provides more detail. </p>
<h2>Styling</h2>
<p>I adore simple black and white text and websites. It's one of the many reasons I keep coming back to <a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a>. I block scripts and tracking on my browsers and convert any page I can into a simple reader. I also adore fast load times. I <strong>hate</strong> sites with auto-playing videos and other cruft.</p>
<p>I used the default simple theme and made some CSS modifications with the help of AI. The current styling is similar to what I built on my homebrew Replit site. The look and feel is heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.mattleaverton.com/">Matt Leaverton's personal site</a> that also runs on Pelican. Matt, we've never met, but I like your style. </p>
<h2>Tracking &amp; Metrics</h2>
<p>I'm not writing this blog for pageviews. Still, it's useful to know who accesses this site, how often, and what they view. I don't need detailed information on every user. The three primary options I considered were: 
1. <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">GoatCounter</a>
2. <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>
3. <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/info?authuser=0">Google Analytics</a> (free version)</p>
<p>Google Analytics is interesting because it would be a great opportunity to play with a tool I would use elsewhere. At the same time, I favor privacy, I think Google's tracking is excessive and invasive, and I block those trackers as a user in my own browsing. If it would annoy me, I'm not going to do it to my users. </p>
<p>I went with GoatCounter because it's free for my use case and <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/help/start">dead simple to install</a> and maintain. </p>
<p>I like the setup so far and it's been extremely easy to update and maintain. It's inspired me to write, so it's already doing its job!</p></section>
