- All styling should be **minimalist**: clean, uncluttered layouts with ample spacing and no unnecessary decoration.  
- Ensure strong **readability and accessibility**:  
  - Minimum 16px base font size.  
  - High contrast for links, buttons, and highlights (e.g., `#00BFFF` for links).  
  - Avoid low-opacity grays and colors that reduce legibility.  
- Prefer modern CSS practices:  
  - Reuse utility classes where possible.  
  - Minimize custom CSS complexity.  
- Keep consistent styling:  
  - Use one font family
  - Consistent spacing (multiples of 4px or 8px).  
- Provide **example CSS snippets** or **inline Tailwind classes** when suggesting UI changes.  
- When generating UI, explain the design intent (why choices were made for readability/usability).
