- All Python code must follow **PEP 8** style guidelines.  
- Use type hints (`def func(x: int) -> str:`) where practical.  
- Add docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules, following **PEP 257** conventions.  
  - Include: short summary line, Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples (if helpful).  
- Inline comments should explain *why* (reasoning) not just *what* the code does.  
- Whenever you create or modify functionality:  
  - Update core documentation files (e.g. `README.md`) with usage, examples, and any new dependencies.  
  - Add or update relevant docstrings.  
  - Provide a summary of changes suitable for AI agents and future contributors (e.g. notes on assumptions, decisions, and trade-offs).  
- Documentation must include **how to run** (commands), **expected outputs**, and at least one **test or example**.  
- If unsure of formatting, prefer the **Google Python Style Guide** docstring format.  
- Update requirements.txt when new packages are installed
