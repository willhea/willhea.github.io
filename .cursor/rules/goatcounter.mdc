- Use **GoatCounter** for site analytics; do not suggest or integrate Google Analytics or other tracking systems.  
- Consult the official GoatCounter documentation: https://www.goatcounter.com/help/start when working on analytics.  
- Default to **privacy-friendly settings**:  
  - Do not collect personally identifiable information (PII).  
  - Respect Do Not Track (DNT) headers.  
- When adding GoatCounter code:  
  - Place the script in the site’s base template (`<head>` or just before `</body>` depending on Pelican theme).  
  - Use the correct site ID or URL provided in project settings (never hard-code secrets).  
  - Provide instructions on how to configure the project’s GoatCounter account.  
- Document all analytics changes in the project docs (e.g., `README.md` or `docs/analytics.md`) including:  
  - Setup steps.  
  - How to test locally vs. production.  
  - How to verify events are tracked.  
- If configuration choices exist (self-hosted vs. hosted, script placement, etc.), explain the trade-offs and recommend the simplest option first.
